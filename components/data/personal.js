  profileMe: `Welcome to my portfolio page. Let's get to know each other a little. I was born and raised in the small southern city of Taganrog. During my school and student years, I focused on the sciences, namely physics and mathematics. I was drawn to a career as an engineer in the field of nanoelectronics. My interest in programming began with a single YouTube video, and I quickly found myself diving headfirst into the world of development. I've found it absolutely thrilling. In IT, I've already met a multitude of interesting people and made dozens of amazing connections. The most rewarding part, however, is the never-ending process of learning and improving.`,
  services: `Let's speak more about my tech stack. So for today it is: Typescript, React, NextJS, Redux and a little bit of React Native. I fell in love with studying (especially on my weekends )so trying to improve my skills every week.`,
  aboutMe: `This is a text block where I should say some pretty words about myself but I think that's enough. Believe me I'm a responsible man and do all everything in my power to improve your project.`,
