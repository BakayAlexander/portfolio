  profileMe: `Welcome to my portfolio page. Let's get to know each other a little. I was born and raised in the small southern city of Taganrog. In my school and student years, I chose the sciences as the main focus of my education, namely physics and mathematics. I was attracted by a career as an engineer in the field of nanoelectronics, but as often happens in our area, it did not work out with a job in my specialty. And suddenly my first job was a position as a marketing manager in a local radio station, after which I changed several jobs in the field of transportation, entertainment, hotel management, and finally entrepreneurship. And then I got interested in programming, first one video on YouTube, then the second, I'm getting my business sold and plunging headlong into the world of development. And, you know, I'm absolutely delighted. In IT, I have already met a bunch of people who are interesting to listen to and made dozens of amazing acquaintances. And the most important thing is the process of improvement, in which you never stop.`,
  services: `Let's speak more about my tech stack. So for today it is: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, React, Redux and a little bit of React Native. I fell in love with studying (especially on my weekends )so trying to improve my skills every week.`,
  aboutMe: `This is a text block where I should say some pretty words about myself but I think that's enough. Believe me I'm a responsible man and do all everything in my power to improve your project.`,
